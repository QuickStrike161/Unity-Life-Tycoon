Overview ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     You play as an entrepreneur destine to change the world. Your decisions will control the path that your character will take and you will grow in strength until you amass an enormous empire.
     
     Because of the amount content and amount of decision making involved in this game it will create incredible potential for replay-ability.
     
     The service sector is the most simplistic of all the sectors.  Businesses in this sector deal with selling goods to customers. Challenges in this sector are balancing supply and demand, and maintaining customer's happiness. This sector is recommended for new players.

     The extraction sector begins to challenge players. Businesses in this sector deal with the extraction of goods such as lumber or minerals as well as farming. Challenges in this sector is to create efficiency as well as filling the demands of customers.

     The processing sector will challenge players abilities. Businesses in this sector create products out of raw materials(factories). The main challenge in this sector is how to secure the goods needed as well as securing costumers to purchase the large volumes of goods created. 
 
     The black market sector will challenge the most skilled players. The constant risk of capture as well as demands of control by force makes this sector a high risk high reward area. This is the only sector where it is possible for the player to loose the game.

Single Player-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	- Start
	     Start the game as a young entrepreneur destine to change the world. A world of possibilities lies before you and the decisions you make will shape your destiny for the better or the worse.
	
	- Gameplay 
	     This game takes all of the best aspects of idle games and combines them with creative builder / strategy game. You start out small but as you sphere of influence grows you shape the world around you, the Universe in the limit. 

	- Beginning Text
     Please note that this game is currently in early development and the game you are about to play is only a small part of what is to come. To find more information about this game you can find it under future in the options menu.

Future -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	- Game Development!
     I want to apologise, I am a single person creating this game, so the creation process will take time, but with your patience and support I hope to make an amazing game in the future. I will try to break down for you some of the ideas and concepts that I have planned for the future. First I will release the Game in stages that you can find on page three. Each stage builds and adds new concepts and challenges for the player to experience.
     Once the game has reached Global domination stage I plan on releasing this game on steam for convenience of the players and the assecciblility. Once on steam I will continue to grow the game stage by stage. After the Final stage has been reached I will switch gears in the development and focus on adding new content to the stages to add depth to the game and start to develop a multiplayer application for the game.

	- Stages!
		○ Employee
		○ Manager
		○ Business owner
		○ Mayor
		○ Premier/Secretary of state
		○ President/Prime-Minister
		○ Global domination
		○ System domination
		○ Galactic domination
		○ Universal domination

     In order to prevent the game from becoming boring/grindy each time the player reaches the required stage the player can choose to be reborn into a new reality gaining their character one level. (As the game develops there will be other ways to gain levels) This level will multiply there skills making the next reality faster, for example if a player is level 10 the game will be at least 10 times faster than when they first played.  

	- Technology!
     One of the important aspects of this game is the implementation of technology and the effects that they will have. The game begins with the technologies that already exist, but once your character reaches the President stage the research tab will be open creating new opportunities. As your character increases their intelligence skill each 100% will give them a research point that they can use to develop new  technologies. 
     As the game grows I want to get feedback from players on technologies that they want to see implemented within the reasurch tree. As time passes I want the technology tree to be large enough that a player may go through the game 10 times and never reasurch the same technology. This will include many sci-fi concepts we know well such as warp drives and terraforming as well as some technologies you have never heard of before.

	- Map Making!
     Map making is going to be one of my challenges for this game, Until the game has been released on steam I will create a premade world that the players will interact with. But for the final three stages the map must become much larger so I plan on creating a procegially generated world. This posses a problem as the player will be changing the map with development and tecnologies and these changes need to be remembered by the computer.
     Part of the appeal of this game is each stage builds upon the previous stages. This means that the created map has to be versatile enough such that a player can go from galaxies to buildings anywhere in the map. To achieve this there will be a limited amount of buildings, using this the game will keep track of the amounts of  buildings for income an other data and will only generate individual parts of the map when selected by the player.  

	- Vision!
     I see this game filling an area of games that have yet to be created. It takes building/ management games and builds on them to give players a new way of looking at these games. Current building games end and start in the same time frame, meaning that you spend all your time in one area of time and there is minimal growth and expansion. I want this game to give players the opportunity to incorporate both large amounts of time and exponential growth into there building games. 
     This will be achieved by giving the player a multitude of technologies for the player to experience and incorporate into the game. The player will grow from an employee in a small business to enormous empire consisting of galaxies with all the responsibilities attached. In the future I plan to add multiplayer aspects into the game allowing you to compete/align with your friends in games that you create, or to test your skills against players around the world in events. 

	- Skills!
     Throughout the game there are five skills that your character will be developing. These skills have a variety of affects designed to make the Game faster with both the higher the stage you are in and the level of your character(your character level multiplies these skills) Also these skills give you points that you can spend within the game. For example every 100% in intelligence gives your character 1 reasurch point. Each sector effects the skills differently. 

	- Game-Play!
     This game at its core is about finances, because of this there is a variety of factors that will effect your character and what they can do. For example one of the main factors that will effect your character is population. Each county/region/city has a designated population that will restrict your growth. These amounts will change over time, as for population this amount will naturally increase over time, but there are ways that you can influence this change and you must use these.
     The following are some of the information that you will have to take into consideration:
	- Population
	- Age demographic
	- Tecnology
	- Net income
	- Living costs
	- Production capacity
	- Raw resources amount/type
     All of these amounts will influence the decisions your character will have to make, but in the same way your character will be able to influence these amounts. To go back to population, once you have reached the mayor stage you can increase housing to increase your towns population to name one way. These stats will keep the game interesting and ultimately as these amounts will change every time you play, keep you on your feet for many games to come.
     Something to note, for the purpose of reducing complicity resources will not run out but have a limit to the amount they can produce (abundance) represented by an amount per game second. This amount will increase with new technology and the innovative skill. I want this game to have many parts for the player to work with but to be a simplistic overview of what is actually needed in the real world equivalent. To keep the game interesting without making it frustrating. 

	- Training!
     As your character progresses through the stages there will be far to much to control for one player. Because of this I added the "Training Academy", this academy will train individuals to control the diffrent stages of the game. This will be set up into the stages, and all stages under your current stage will be available. When you select a stage you can control the amount of people in this stage as well as how much training they receive.
     Basically you can hire people to do the jobs you use to do so that you don't have to. But this comes with a price, more training will make individuals more efficient but will also cost more, as well as individuals age over time and when they retire you will have to hire new people to take there place. Finally these people will want to be paid for there work, this amount will vary depending on the stage they control. 

	- Donations
     As I have said before I am a single developer so your support is greatly appreciated. As a way of showing my gratitude for any donations I have created a reward system for the top 100 people, varying depending on there position as well as a reward for the first 10 people that donate more than 20$. For all donations greater than 20$ your information will be kept and when the game has been released on steam you will receive a free copy of the game including all future updates. 

Future -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stages -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first 4  character levels of this game are designed to be a type of tutorial. In each of these levels you will be required to select the levels sector. 
	• Service (level 1)
	• Extraction(level 2)
	• Processing (level 3)
	• Black Market(level 4)
I designed it this way because of the games complicity, each of these areas deal with a game aspect that will be required of your character later on in the game. This makes it so that the information is divided up into smaller simpler parts. Also the levels act as a skill multiplier, meaning that every level that your character gains makes the game faster(see 1). Since the last few stages take much longer this makes the game lest grindy. Your character levels up each time the designated stage has been achieved and your current game will be complete(see 2).

	1. For example the first time you do the employee stage it should take about an hour, when you character is level 10 this stage will take 6 min
	2. 
	• Employee
	• Manager
	• Business owner
	• Mayor(level 1)
	• Premier/Secretary of state(level 2)
	• President/Prime-Minister(level 3)
	• Global domination(level 4,5)
	• System domination(level 6,7)
	• Galactic domination(level 8,9,10)
Universal domination(rest of levels)

Stages -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skills -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The skills are:
- Management(employee speed)
- Innovative(goods/resources created)
- Intelligence(The speed of training/research)
- Quality(value of goods/resources)
- Strategic(battle rating)

The next pages breakdown how the different sectors affect the skills. For example Management(2) means that this sector effects the management skill and has a multiplier of 2. So if you are in this sector your workers will be more efficient.

- Service
	○ Management(2)
	○ Intelligence(1) 
	○ Quality(0.5)
	○ Strategic(0.5)

- Extraction
	○ Innovative(2)
	○ Quality(1)
	○ Management(0.5)
	○ Strategic(0.5)
	
- Processing 
	○ Quality(2)
	○ Innovative(1)
	○ Management(0.5)
	○ Strategic(0.5)
	
- Black Market
	○ Strategic(3)
	○ Intelligence(2) 
	○ Management(1)
	○ Quality(0.5)

Because of these amounts, your character will have to expand to the different sectors of the game at higher stages so that they can become well-versed in all of the skills.

Skills -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stages Info ------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Employee
     This is the first and easiest stage of the game. This stage allows the player to experience the building blocks of the game thus enabling them to better control and grow there empire. During the first game this stage will take approximately an hour, but this will quickly diminish with increased player levels. (At level 10 it will take 6 min)
     In this stage the player will be placed into a business within the sector of there choosing and do the "grunt work" of the business such as producing goods, mining or engaging with customers. Success in this sector is achieved by serving/producing/creating the required amount of goods. Although simple this stage will still challenge the player by requiring them to work at the various aspects of there business to achieve efficiency. When in this stage your character will make a set wage that they will use to purchase training for themselves to increase productivity.

-Manager
     In the second stage your character has been promoted to a manager. Now in addition to being able to work as an employee you are now in control of hiring employee's, managing merchandise, maintaining the business grounds, and customer relations. As in the first stage this looks different in each of the different sectors.
     Success in this stage will be achieved when after you purchase your first business. You do not have to purchase the business you are currently working in but it is recommended because it will be discounted to you. In this stage your character will make a percentage of the profits, this amount is set at 20%.

-Business Owner
    After you purchase your first business the game changes. For the first two stages your character has been very restricted as to what they can do, that is no longer the case you are now in full control of your business and you can do whatever you want with it. You will have to create new strategies for efficiency in order to increase your profit and influence and there are a variety of new paths available to your character.
     Success in this stage will be achieved when your character has been elected for mayor. You can affect influence(votes) in a number of ways: Your employees will vote for you depending on their happiness, depending on your amount of customers and customer relations, and through your campaign platform. This will take time and you will have to own much of the town in order to become the mayor, meaning that larger towns will take longer to reach this stage.

-Mayor
     Once you have been elected the game will change once again. In addition to running your businesses you must run/maintain your city. You are responsible for city panning which includes designating town zones, road/path construction and government services(schools, hospitals, fire stations). As now you own many businesses within the town it is up to you how you will use your new powers to increase/expand your businesses.
       Success in this stage is achieved when you have been elected as premier(Secretary of state) of the region that you are the mayor in. (Note it is possible to be the mayor of more than one city) Being elected requires influence of the region, influence is gain in the same way as for mayor as well mayor rating will influence as well. At this stage of the game it is possible to purchase towns thus becoming the mayor of them without influence but this is very pricy.

-Premier
     Once you have been elected as premier there will be a few new changes. You are now responsible for infrastructure within your region. Meaning you will now create roads and major building projects within your region. You are also responsible for the development of natural resources, which means that you can now develop new businesses within the extraction sector. You are also responsible for the creation of power which a new area of income. 
     Success in this stage is achieved when you have been elected as president(Prime-Minister) of the country you are premier in. (Note it is possible to be the premier of more than one region) Being elected requires influence over the country, influence is gain in the same way as for mayor stage as well as your development rating. At this stage of the game it is possible to purchase regions thus becoming the premier of them without influence but this is very pricy.

-President
     Once you have been elected as president you will have to control more than just your finances and influence. The reasurch menu will now be open to you and you will have to be careful to spend your reasurch points wisely. You will also be able to create and control an army as well as maintaining international relations with other countries. You are also able to change tax as well as influence tariffs(tax on imported/exported goods).
     Success in this stage will be achieved when you have full control of all the countries of the world. There are a variety of ways you can gain control of a new country you can do it the same way as you have by owning most of the country and being elected. But you can also gain control through force as well as international relations. 
      You will have to learn balance as you will have to maintain the worlds view of you. Some countries you will have to be take with force, but if you are to aggressive the world will see you as a tyrant and will join forces against you. Thus you will have to learn timing and have alliances so that if war comes your will be able to win. Note: just because you are in control of a county does not mean that you own it, to own a country you must purchase all of its businesses. 
      
-Global Domination
     You are now in control of your home planet, but you will soon realize if you want to continue to grow you will have to move beyond the reaches of your world. You must reasurch new tecnologies and start new projects to begin expanding your empire to the stars. You must explore your solar system and you will soon find that the planets around you contain valuable resources that you must claim and extract for your future growth and expansion. 
     Success in this will be achieved when you have claimed all of the planets within your solar system. You can claim a baron planet in a variety of ways, exploration(explore the required amount of the planet with satellites and probes), population(Grow and sustain the required population on the planet), development(set up extraction facilities producing and transporting the required amount of goods to your home planet).

-Rest
     I have not worked out all the details for the last three stages of the game, much of it may change as I work through the other stages of the game. Here are a few of the concepts that I am planning on adding. Continued growth and expansion of your empire and the challenges of space, the discovery and transition to a universal currency. New tecnology and the creation of mega projects. Galactic wars waged between massive civilizations spanning years and galaxies.   
     There are going to be three types of planets within the game baron, habitable, habited. Most of the planets that you will encounter will be baron planets, this means that the atmosphere does not support human life, some of these planets will still have unintelligent lifeforms living there. Habitable planets will be much rarer, they will occur once in 5-10 solar systems. These planets have no intelligent life but have an environment suitable to humans.
     The final type of planets are habited plannets. These will occur a few times in every galaxy, the habitants of these plannets will have varying levels of development and tecnology as well as the growth of there empire, you will have to conquer or influence these people in order to achieve your final goal. These civilizations will be very diffrent then yours and relations with them will unlock new reasurch and buildings. Also some habited plannets will not be habitable for humans. 
     For this part of the game the entire map will not be discovered, you will have to send out ships and probes into the far reaches of space. These probes will slowly reveal parts of the map to you. The only part of space that is discovered for you is your initial solar system. Finally depending on the tecnologies you choose to discover terraforming will become possible for plannets within the correct distance from the sun to create new habitable plannets.
